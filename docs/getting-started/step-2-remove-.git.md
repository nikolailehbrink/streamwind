# ðŸ§¹ Step 2: Remove .git

To make this project your own, you'll need to remove any traces of the original `.git` directory. This ensures that you can initialize a fresh new Git repository for your project.

To remove the `.git` folder, follow the OS-specific instructions below:

#### For macOS and Linux users:

```bash
cd streamwind
rm -rf .git
```

#### For Windows users:

```bash
cd streamwind
rmdir .git -Recurse -Force
```

Congratulations! You've successfully detached your project from the original Git history
