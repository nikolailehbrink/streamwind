# üë®üíª Step 4: Start Developing

Now that you've set up your environment, it's time to start the development process. To bundle all files and launch the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will automatically watch for changes in your source files and rebuild the project accordingly.

And there you have it! You're all set to start crafting your amazing WordPress website using StreamWind. Happy coding! üéâ

## My recommendation: Developing with LocalWP üõ†Ô∏è

LocalWP is a free, open-source software that lets you quickly and easily set up a local development environment for your WordPress projects. With LocalWP, you can create multiple WordPress sites, manage plugins and themes, and test your code changes in a safe and isolated environment.

To get started with LocalWP, download and install the software from their [official website](https://localwp.com/). Once installed, you can create a new WordPress site, import an existing one, or clone a site from a remote server.
