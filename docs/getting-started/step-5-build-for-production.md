# 🏁 Step 5: Build for Production

Once you've finished developing your theme, it's time to prepare it for the big world out there. Building for production ensures that your theme is optimized, fast, and ready to impress your visitors.

To build your theme for production, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run production
```

This command will optimize your code, minify assets, and bundle everything up for a production-ready deployment. The output files will be placed in the corresponding folders that the theme then enqeues.

And that's it! You've successfully built your WordPress theme for production using StreamWind.🎉
